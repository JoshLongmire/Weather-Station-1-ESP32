### Logging and storage

- **File**: `/logs.csv` on SD card; created with header `timestamp,temp_f,humidity,pressure,lux,voltage`.
- **When it logs**:
  - Once per wake in `handleLive()` guarded by `loggedThisWake`.
  - Periodically in day mode via `performLogging()` every `LOG_INTERVAL_MS` (10 minutes).
- **Data sources**:
  - Temperature reported in °F (BME280 °C converted to °F).
  - Humidity in %RH, pressure in hPa, lux from BH1750, battery voltage from ADC35 × divider.
- **Download**: `/download` streams the CSV.
- **Reset**: `/reset` deletes and recreates the CSV with header.
